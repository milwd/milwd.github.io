                                This project is an interactive drone simulation that operates in a terminal-based environment using ncurses. The simulation consists of:
                                A controllable drone navigating in a bounded area, Randomly appearing and disappearing obstacles and targets, Repulsion forces following Khatib's model, 
                                Multiple modes of operation, including local and remote object generation using FastDDS. It can be used extensively for path-planning of drones with respect to 
                                avoidable regions.

                                This project implements Q-learning, a fundamental reinforcement learning algorithm, to solve the classic CartPole problem from OpenAI's Gym environment. 
                                The CartPole environment is a benchmark task in reinforcement learning where the objective is to balance a pole on a moving cart by applying forces to the cart.
                                The agent learns to maximize the total reward by interacting with the environment, observing its state, and taking actions guided by a learned Q-table. 
                                Through iterative updates, the agent improves its decision-making to keep the pole balanced for as long as possible.

                                A motor tries to balance a ball on a rod (plate). 
                                By implementing PID controllers and using ToF Laser-ranging sensors, 
                                the device can hold the ball stable on any distances on the rod, specified by user. 
                                It uses ESP8266 as controller device and server for web connection.
