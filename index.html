            <p class="justified-text">My name is Milad Rabiei. I'm a senior-year undergrad of Electrical Engineering, Electronics and Communications at Shahid Beheshti University, Tehran. 
                <br><br>
                Professionally, I'm interested in Autonomous Systems, Computer Vision in Robotics, and Reinforcement Learning. 
                The combination of computer vision and control systems, especially path planning algorithms, have proven to be a robust solution to robot autonomy. 
                My main field of interest can be described as the intersect of vision, control, and learning algorithms. <br>
                Detailed Areas of interest: <b>vision-based SLAM, online learning, scene understanding, and 3D object classification</b>.
                <br><br>
                Personally, I like hiking and volleyball. I also enjoy reading old stories from the world of computer science.

            There has been a growth in the applications of autonomous transport systems in recent years, and small-scale robots are widely used as prototypes for investigating new algorithms. 
            This study focuses on emulating a full-size autonomous vehicle on a low-cost 1:10 scale robot. 
            Various computer vision, machine learning, and control algorithms are implemented throughout this study, and the system communication architecture is based on ROS.

        <h4>Maintaining Privacy in Generative AI</h3>
        <br>
        <p class="justified-text">
            The advent of location-based services has led to the widespread adoption of indoor localization systems, which enable location tracking of individuals within enclosed spaces such as buildings. 
            While these systems provide numerous benefits such as improved security and personalized services, they also raise concerns regarding privacy violations. 
            As such, there is a growing need for privacy-preserving solutions that can protect usersâ€™ sensitive location information while still enabling the functionality of indoor localization systems.
            In recent years, Differentially Private Generative Adversarial Networks have emerged as a powerful methodology that aims to protect the privacy of individual data points while generating realistic synthetic data similar to original data. 
            DPGANs combine the power of generative adversarial networks with the privacy-preserving technique of differential privacy.
